# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Background and Purpose:
Basil and Sadhana like how you created your earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. Now, Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.

## Deliverable 1: Add Techtonic Plate Data
We want to see if there is a corelation with the earthquakes and the techtonic plates. In the Module we created a view that let us see the Earthquakes in the last week.Now we are to add the earthquake data with the tectonic plate data as a second layer.

We also have to have it so that both the earthquakes and the tectonic plates both display when the webpage loads.

## Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data
We will now add color and set the radius of the circle markers based on the magnitude of earthquake, and add a popup marker for each earthquake that displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake using the GeoJSON layer. 

This new Overlay will be benefical to our research as it will clear the "clutter" of the smaller magnatude earthquakes. All the earthquake data and tectonic plate data are displayed on the map when the page loads and the datasets can be toggled on or off.

## Deliverable 3: Add Additional Map

Using our knowledge of JavaScript and Leaflet.js add a third map style to the earthquake map. Since some users like to do their work at night, I thought it would be benefical to have a dark mode layer to the webpage. This way we can look at the earthquake data with less strain on our eyes. We already have our normal views of streets and satellite.
